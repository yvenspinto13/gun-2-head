# Goa, Covid, Accountability

Just an accountability repo to know the gross misconduct of the government of goa

[Check it out here](https://goa-covid-accountability.web.app/home)

This is a work in progress, but I hope to complete it

For now, you can clone the repo and run and manipulate it and do what you like

The data directory has python scripts for downloading / scraping and extracting data from media bulletins
I could not find a digital source, so if yourl do come across, do let me know

The server is an express app hat will give you the cummulative json from the media bulletins

The ui is a react app with chart js for viewing the data
